# Project-2-Pipelines


## Introduction
### In my project I will be exploring premier league football players and their relation to the stats they have in fifa 22. First things first. I have taken just the Stikers/Forwards. This is because they are the easiest to compare their performance as their job is fairly simple, to score goals.

## Hypothesis
### My hypothesis or what im trying to prove is that players rating, wage, and value in fifa 22 is correlated to their performance in real life.

## Conclusion
### I came to the conclusion that none of the stats correlate. This could be because of the year i took for premier league was still getting added on and was incomplete as it was during the season. If i had chose a previous year that was complete it could have helped give an accurate answer. Also in football its the teams wealth that determines how much they can pay their player. Some teams have more money to spend because of sponsors. Also players can have sponsorships on their own too which can add to their value.
